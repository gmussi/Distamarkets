# Contracts

## WFAIRToken

For more information on WFAIR token, check the [official repository](https://github.com/wallfair-organization/WFAIR-Token).

The `WFAIRToken` is an ERC20 token that uses ERC1363 extentions. 
The ERC20 implementation is provided by OpenZeppelin, and ERC1363 extensions are by https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token.

The extensions are intended for the token to be used within the Wallfair ecosystem, interacting with PLP, Staking, DAO without the need of an additional `approve` transaction.

## Distamarkets (Prototype name)

`Distamarkets` implement many of the functionalities as described by the [Wallfair whitepaper](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61ba8371c8bbe82d0a9cf967/61c49c523f82eb0b156095a7_wallfair-whitepaper.pdf).

The contract allows the following:

1. Create markets
2. Place bets (add stake in outcome) in markets
3. Remove bets from markets early
4. Cancel markets and refunds
5. Resolution of markets and rewards distribution
6. Dispute resolution

# Installation

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/gmussi/Distamarkets.git`

Ensure you have node.js and npm installed. You must be using **npm version >= 7**.

Then install the required packages for the Hardhat toolchain:

Next, try compiling the contracts to see if it has all worked:

`npm run compile`

# Testing
We use the `hardhat waffle` plugin to write tests. Tests can be run using:

`npm run test`

# Coverage
We use solidity-coverage with `npm run coverage`.

# Linter
We use the `hardhat solhint` plugin to check code styling. It can be run with:

`npm run linter`

Alternatively, to guarantee code is in good condition, we use prettify plugin with:

`npx prettier --write 'contracts/**/*.sol'`
