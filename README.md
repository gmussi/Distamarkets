# Contracts

## WFAIRToken

For more information on WFAIR token, check the [official repository](https://github.com/wallfair-organization/WFAIR-Token).

The `WFAIRToken` is an ERC20 token that uses ERC1363 extentions. 
The ERC20 implementation is provided by OpenZeppelin, and ERC1363 extensions are by https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token.

The extensions are intended for the token to be used within the Wallfair ecosystem, interacting with PLP, Staking, DAO without the need of an additional `approve` transaction.

## Distamarkets (Prototype name)

`Distamarkets` implement many of the functionalities as described by the [Wallfair whitepaper](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61ba8371c8bbe82d0a9cf967/61c49c523f82eb0b156095a7_wallfair-whitepaper.pdf).

The contract allows the following:

1. Creating a market by calling the `createMarket` method.
2. Allow users to stake tokens in an outcome of a market by using `approveAndCall` on the WFAIR token contract.
3. Allow users to remove stake from an outcome and get their tokens refunded.
4. Allow market creators and arbiters to cancel and resolve markets.
5. Allow users to dispute resolve markets before the limit time.
6. Allow a stake-and-slash voting style for dispute resolution in markets.
